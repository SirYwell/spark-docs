To install spark, just need to download the latest spark **.jar** file from our [downloads page](https://spark.lucko.me/download) and place in the server `mods` or `plugins` folder.

spark will load the next time your server (re)starts.

You will be able to control spark with the `/spark` command.

You may need to grant yourself the `spark` permission, or ensure your user is a server operator first.

:::note

If you are running [Paper](https://papermc.io/software/paper) 1.21 or newer, spark is **already bundled as part of the server** - no need to install the plugin jar!

To override the Paper-bundled version of spark with the spark plugin, you need to append `-Dpaper.preferSparkPlugin=true` to your server startup arguments.
For more information, please see the [Paper documentation](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/profiling).
